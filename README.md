# ChatGTP
## This version doesn't actualy have artificial inteligence features and only reads from a file (and keyboard input) and answears certain basic questions based on the information read from the file 😁.

### It was mostly made as a joke project with my classmate Orestis Zappas 1.5 years ago that i wasnt sure if i should upload.


Features:
- Read from file
- Interact with user
- Forgeting a concept
- Lists (search, insert, delete)
- Saves Discussions
